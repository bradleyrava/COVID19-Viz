# Cleaned Data Files

These are the cleaned data files that we use for our COVID-19 Rt visualization.
These files are generated by `02_clean_merge.R`.

+ `names_list.rds`: A list of lists that maps UIDs of locations to their names.
  The outer list contains entries for states/provinces, US counties, countries,
  and US states with counties (Some "states" like Puerto Rico or DC don't have
  counties).
+ `rt_long_all.rds` A long tibble containing the Rt and various other variables
  for each location and each date.
+ `sf_all.rds`: An [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) object containing
  the Rt values merged with the shape information for each geographical entity
  on our map (states/provinces, counties, and countries).
+ `state_centers.rds`: A list mapping state UIDs to their centers. Used for
  setting the location and zoom for the map on the explore states tab.
